# Customizable Contraction Hierarchies

There was an [issue open](https://github.com/itinero/routing/issues/92).

## Goal

Implement a prototype of Customizable Contraction Hierarchies and:

- Test if it handles the current usecases as good as the current implementation.
- Test if it can handle dynamic weight recalculations as advertised.
- Design a new way to handle contraction in Itinero if tests succeed.

## Approach

Start in a seperate branch and strip out all current contraction code and start experimenting.

## Status
